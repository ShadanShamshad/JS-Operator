    <!-- Discuss the precedence and associativity of operators in JavaScript. Why is understanding these concepts important? -->
    <h2>Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression. <br>

        Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).</h2>

        <p>
            Expressions in parentheses are computed before the rest of the expression <br>
          <b>  Function are executed before the result is used in the rest of the expression</b>
        </p>
        <span class="red-color">
            Assignments are executed after other operations
        </span>

        <h2> Understanding how these operators work and when to use them is an important skill for any programmer.</h2>

        <p>
            Basically, programming is done for a variety of reasons and one of the important reasons why programming is 
            done is to operate on the values in the variables with high accuracy and faster speed.
