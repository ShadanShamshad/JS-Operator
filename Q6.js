// Write a Javascript program to calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the formula BMI = weight (kg)/height * height. 
//height in cm

const weight = 45;
const height = 152;

let BMI = weight / (height * height);
console.log(`Body Mass Index is ${BMI}`);

// The output is : Body Mass Index is 0.0019477146814404433
