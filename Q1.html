    <!-- Explain the role of operators in JavaScript. Why are they essential in programming -->
        <p>
            Basically, programming is done for a variety of reasons and one of the important reasons why programming is 
            done is to operate on the values in the variables with high accuracy and faster speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Operators are symbols or keywords that represent specific actions or operations to be performed on one or 
            more operands.
        </p>
        <p>
            An operand is a data value that the operator will carry out the actions. It is the values on which we operate.
        </p>
