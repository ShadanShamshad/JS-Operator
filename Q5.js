   //  Write a JavaScript program that calculates the simple interest using the formula Simple interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100. 
    
    const principle = 500;
    const time = 3;
    const rate =4;

    let SI = (principle * time * rate)/100;
    console.log(`Simple Interest is ${SI}`);
    
// The output is :  Simple Interest is 60
