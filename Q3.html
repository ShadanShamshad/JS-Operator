                <p>
                    Unary operators are operators that perform actions on a single operand. Let's explore some of the Unary 
                    operators: 
                    <ul>
                        <li><span> Unary Plus('+') :</span> 
                            <p>
                                The unary plus operator is used to convert its operand into a number. While this might seem redundant, it becomes valuable when dealing with user inputs that need to be explicitly converted to numbers. <br>
                                Example: <br>
                                let numString  = "10"; <br>
                                let negativeNum = +numString;     // Output: 10 <br>
                                <span class="red-color">
                                    We are declaring a variable numString and assigning it the value "42", which is a string representing the characters "4" and "2". <br>

                                Then, We use the unary plus operator (+) on numString to convert it into a number. This unary plus operation constrain the string "42" into the numeric value 42
                                </span>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><span>Unary negation('-')</span> 
                        <p>
                            The unary negation operator is used to negate the value of its operand, effectively changing its sign.
                            Example: <br>
                            let num = 10; <br>
                            let negativeNum = -num;     // Output: -10 <br>
                            <span class="red-color">The unary negation operator simply changes the sign of a number. If the number is positive, it becomes negative, and if it's negative, it becomes positive</span>
                        </p>
                        </li>

                        <li><span class="subheading">Binary Operator</span>

                                Bitwise operators are used in programming to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. These operators are commonly used in tasks that require low-level manipulation of data, such as working with hardware, optimizing code, and cryptography.
                                
                                <p>
                                    Bitwise operators are essential tools for performing low-level bit manipulation in programming. They are commonly used in scenarios where you need to optimize code, work with binary data, or interface with hardware. 
                                </p>
                                <span>The most commonly used 
                                    bitwise operators in programming are as follows.</span>

                                        <p>
                                            The bitwise AND operator (`&`) compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set to 1 only if both corresponding bits in the original integers are 1. Otherwise, it sets the bit to 0.
                                            <br>
                                            Syntax: <br>

                                            <p>
                                                The bitwise OR operator (|) compares each bit of two integers and returns a Yew integer. In the resulting 
                                                integer, each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the original integers is 1.

                                                The bitwise XOR operator (`^`) compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set to 1 if only one of the corresponding bits in the original integers is 1.

                                            The bitwise NOT operator (`~`) is a unary operator that flips the bits of an integer, changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.

                                            Bitwise left shift (`<<`) and right shift (`>>`) operators are used to shift the bits of an integer to the left or right by a specified number of positions.

                               The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write simple conditional statements.
                                The syntax is in the following way: <br>
